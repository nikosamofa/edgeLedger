      <h2><strong> Profile</strong> </h2>
      <p>Client A provides order and wholesale digital printing services in the Australian market.</p>

     <h2><strong>Challenge</strong> </h2> 
      <p>Client A’s biggest challenge was identifying factors leading to drop-offs on their website. The brand’s marketing team struggled to figure out:

        <ul class="case-list">
          <li>Where people spent their time</li>
          <li>What users were interested in </li>
          <li> What caused them to drop off</li>
          <li>They wanted actionable insights into how users interacted with their site.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- * Where people spent their time
        * What users were interested in 
        * What caused them to drop off
        They wanted actionable insights into how users interacted with their site.</p>  -->

      <h2><strong>Action plan</strong> </h2>
      <ul class="case-list">
        <li>Focus groups to discuss needs and feelings towards the product after direct observation of one user at a time - 9 users discussed issues and concerns about features on the website</li>
        <li>leveraged Hotjar to analyze web performance and understand user behavior at a granular level. They used:
          <ol>
            <li>Funnels to locate the exact drop-off points in the customer journey</li>
            <li>Session Recordings to understand how each user behaved on the site, tracing mouse and scroll movements to see which elements users click on </li>
            <li>Heatmaps to view color-coded representations of popular and unpopular site elements to help discover areas where users spend the most time and determine those that need improvement</li>
          </ol>


        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> 
        
        <!-- * Funnels to locate the exact drop-off points in the customer journey
        * Session Recordings to understand how each user behaved on the site, tracing mouse and scroll movements to see which elements users click on 
        * Heatmaps to view color-coded representations of popular and unpopular site elements to help discover areas where users spend the most time and determine those that need improvement -->
        
        This action plan helped the team zero in on their pricing table as a major blocker.</p>

      <h2><strong>Results</strong></h2> 
      <ul class="case-list">
        <li>Zeroed in on their pricing table as a major blocker. </li>
        <li>Conducted split testing of multiple layouts to optimize the pricing table. </li>
        <li>With a simple change in their pricing plan, the team reduced drop-off rates by 7% and boosted its conversion rate by 2%.</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- <p>Once Client A identified the problem, the next step was split testing multiple layouts to optimize the pricing table. With a simple change in their pricing plan, the Client A team reduced drop-off rates by 7% and boosted its conversion rate by 2%.</p>  -->
      <h2> <strong> Key Take-ways</strong> </h2>
