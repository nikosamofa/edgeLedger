     <h2><strong>Challenge</strong> </h2> 
      <p>Client B is a UK-based marketplace for construction material manufacturers and customers.</p>
      <p>The co-founders wanted to optimize their website experience by improving three problem areas:</p>

        <ul class="case-list">
          <li>Poorly placed calls to action (CTAs), where mobile users could not see the CTA clearly enough to click on it</li>
          <li>Customer drop-offs at the checkout step because users only wanted to check the delivery time</li>
          <li>A complicated cookie policy that caused visitors to bounce as soon as they landed on the website</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- * Where people spent their time
        * What users were interested in 
        * What caused them to drop off
        They wanted actionable insights into how users interacted with their site.</p>  -->

      <h2><strong>Action plan</strong> </h2>
      <ul class="case-list">
        <li>Heuristic analysis - asked expert users to perform the key tasks within the conversion funnel (e.g. login, find product X, add product X to cart) to discover user pain points and report </li>
        <li>Focus groups to discuss needs and feelings towards the product after direct observation of one user at a time - 6 users discussed issues and concerns about features on the website </li>
        <li>Used Hotjar Recordings and Heatmaps to dig deeper into these UX research issues:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>We improved the visibility of CTAs with changes to font, color, and design. The team also included a rating widget next to the CTAs to display social proof.</li>
            <li>We removed the need to set up an account to place an order and added an estimated delivery date for every product</li>
            <li>We implemented design changes in the cookie policy pop-up to make it 30% bigger with better color and copy. They also placed the banner on the top of the page.</li>
          </ol>
         
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The result was a gradual upgrade of the website to meet—and exceed—customer expectations.</p>
        
        <!-- * Funnels to locate the exact drop-off points in the customer journey
        * Session Recordings to understand how each user behaved on the site, tracing mouse and scroll movements to see which elements users click on 
        * Heatmaps to view color-coded representations of popular and unpopular site elements to help discover areas where users spend the most time and determine those that need improvement -->
        
        <!-- This action plan helped the team zero in on their pricing table as a major blocker.</p> -->

      <h2><strong>Results</strong></h2> 
      <ul class="case-list">
        <li>Redesigning the checkout flow decreased drop-offs by 86%.
</li>
        <li>The conversion rate tripled to 1.6% — massively boosting yearly revenue by more than £10,000.
</li>
        
      </ul>
      <!-- <p>Once Client A identified the problem, the next step was split testing multiple layouts to optimize the pricing table. With a simple change in their pricing plan, the Client A team reduced drop-off rates by 7% and boosted its conversion rate by 2%.</p>  -->
     
      <h2> <strong> Key Takeaways</strong> </h2> 
<ul class="case-list">
  <li>UX research tools like recordings are a great way to understand user behavior on your website—you can sort and filter recordings by relevance</li>
  
</ul>
